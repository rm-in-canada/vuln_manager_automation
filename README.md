# vuln_manager_automation
Trying to manage and report vulnerabilities with more automation code and less whatever bad feeling you might have

This repository is created to enable security officers with some sort of automation.

My current main source of samples is "Weakness", the vulnerability portal inside Defender. 

My intention is to share excel code or python or anything I can find to make Vuln Mng easier
